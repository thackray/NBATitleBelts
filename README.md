This is the code and data to determine which NBA team holds the pro-wrestling-style Title Belt for both winning and losing.
The rules for the Loser Title Belt (invert winning/losing for Winner Title Belt):
  1) The team that lost the first game in NBA history was the first team awarded with the LTB
  2) The LTB goes to whatever team manages to lose to the current LTB holder
  3) If a team retires (folds as a franchise) on top of the LTB world, the last team they lost to gets the LTB
